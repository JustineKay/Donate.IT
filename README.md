# Donate.IT  

###Description
Donate.IT is an iOS App for donating and receiving tech equipment.   

* You can create a listing for any phone, laptop, or tablet you'd like to donate to someone in need.   
* You can also make a request for an item listed for donation and the app will send an email to the donor with your contact email.  
* The donor and the recipient coordinate the exchange via email.  
* When both parties have marked the item as successfully donated/received, the donor will receive a tax receipt via email.

This project originated from the Coalition for Queens Access Code 2.2 Hackathon Oct 31 - Nov 1, 2015.
